        "But first we have to understand some fundamentals. Because we are interested in the output power, not just merely the produced $emf$ without a load. For our $V_{open} = 12V$ solar cell the maximum output power we measured was $V_{max} = 18V$. For best performance we have to find the MPP - maximum power point. But a [MPPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_point_tracking) is out of reach for students, so we estimate this point and design a fitting resistor.\n",
